# Facial Emotion Recognition

A machine learning / computer vision project for detecting facial expressions and classifying them into emotions from images or video frames.

## Overview

This project aims to recognize human emotions from facial images using computer vision and machine learning techniques. It can be used in applications such as:

- Human-computer interaction
- Sentiment analysis
- Smart surveillance
- Customer experience analytics
- Accessibility tools

## Features

- Detects faces from images or video input
- Classifies facial expressions into emotion categories
- Can be extended for real-time emotion recognition
- Easy to integrate into other computer vision pipelines

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- Machine Learning / Deep Learning
- NumPy
- TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch  *(update based on your implementation)*

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rehanabbaxi/Facial-Emotion-Recognition.git
cd Facial-Emotion-Recognition
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

#### Activate the virtual environment

**Windows:**
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

If the project includes a training script:

```bash
python train.py
```

If the project includes an inference or demo script:

```bash
python app.py
```

Or run the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Dataset

This project uses facial expression data for training and evaluation.  
If you used a public dataset, list it here, for example:

- FER-2013
- CK+
- RAF-DB

## Model

If applicable, describe your model here:

- Architecture: CNN / transfer learning / custom model
- Input size: e.g. `48x48` grayscale images
- Output classes: e.g. `angry`, `happy`, `sad`, `neutral`, etc.

## Results

Add your results here, such as:

- Training accuracy
- Validation accuracy
- Confusion matrix
- Sample predictions

Example:

- Accuracy: 92%
- Validation Loss: 0.18

## Future Improvements

- Improve real-time detection speed
- Support more emotion categories
- Enhance robustness under different lighting conditions
- Deploy as a web or mobile application
